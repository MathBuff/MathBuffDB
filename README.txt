I've Finally Figured this git stuff out I think, WSL is hard but cool.
Refference for me to get a fast WSL start:
cd /mnt/c/Users/Lucas/Desktop/MathBuffDB


=====PROGRAM FILE STRUCTURE=====

/src
contains all the cpp files and main, aka the source files.

/include
contains all header files for my source files.

/build
Contains the executable a.out for the program once compiled.

/lib
Is currently empty cause I have no precompiled libraries to work with at the moment.

/README
Oh hi, looks like you made it.
This is where I'll be organizing the Program stuff.

/run
This is a .sh file that contains a bash script that I use the windows subsystem
for linux with in order to more readily test the program using the command line 
via the clang compiler.
